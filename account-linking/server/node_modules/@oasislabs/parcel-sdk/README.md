# Parcel SDK

The Parcel platform makes it easy to build privacy-first applications. Whether
you're building consumer apps or business tools, Parcel can help you
automatically implement data ownership and access policies, consume data in a
privacy-preserving environment, and unlock data that was previously too
regulated or risky to use.

The Parcel SDK is a client implementation library, written in Typescript
and compatible with Node.js.
