 * Example: `OASIS_SDK_LOG_LEVEL='warn,gateway=error,http.*auth=trace'` is interpreted as:
 *  - Every logger should log at level "warn".
 *  - Loggers whose name contains "gateway" should log at level "error"
 *  - Loggers whose name matches the regex "http.*auth" should log at "trace"
 *
 * The default logging level is "silent". If a logger name matches multiple rules, the last rule prevails.
 * The spec can be very simple, e.g. `OASIS_SDK_LOG_LEVEL=warn`.
